Static pod:

    This pod are not manage by schedular but it deploy on control plane node and control plane and manage by kubelet in control manager node.

    If you're building or managing Kubernetes infrastructure or need to ensure critical services are always available on specific nodes, static pods are a valuable tool. 

Taints and Tolerations: 

    Taints prevent pods from being scheduled on specific nodes unless they have matching tolerations, ensuring that only appropriate workloads run on those nodes.

    Tolerations allow pods to be scheduled on nodes with specific taints by tolerating them, bypassing the scheduling restrictions.

    Together, taints and tolerations help control pod placement and node utilization in Kubernetes.
    
        operator: Specifies the comparison logic between the key and the taint. Common operators are:
            Exists: The toleration matches any taint with the specified key, regardless of the value.
            Equal: The toleration matches only taints with the exact key-value pair.

    Label apply to node:
         by apply label to node the pod has power to go with which node
